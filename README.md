### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Im a final year Creative Computing Student at IADT, learning a variety of different programming languages such as JavaScript (React, Vue, Express), R, Java and Python, as well as soft skills like problem solving and teamwork. I have used these skills to develop several applications, websites, and games throughout my studies.
